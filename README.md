* Universities
* and others

Whats is new?
=============

* Special system agree/desagree in posts entries
* Collective way of administration and moderation
* Little anti-fake system based on collective decision

Who I am?
=========

I'm Halan Pinheiro, software developer, and anarchist politic. I belong to the group #foramicarla, a group against the current mayor in my city (and against the representative democracy system). We think about something like this system, couse we don't trust in the companies that maintain the social-networks, and we need a system more private.


Enjoy it
